## Lesson 1
The Python programming language was named after the Monty
Python’s Flying Circus TV show, not after python the snake.
According to [Python.org](https://python.org): "Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively."
### The Shell
Python commands are executed one line at a time. The action takes place in the Python shell. A typical Python shell looks like this.

Here's a code example executed in the Python shell.

### In this class we are going to use the Mu Editor which is designed for beginning programmers. 
The Mu Editor comes with the software included with your Raspberry Pi computer.

### We need to learn how to use our Mu Editor. Here is a great tutorial which will get us started on our Python Learning Journey.

### We can enter code in the REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop). The REPL is pictured below. 
![REPL](https://github.com/donwatkins/PyGirls4Good/blob/master/Images/Mu_REPL.png)


### At the REPL enter the following expressions
* 2 + 3
* 2 * 3 
* 3/5
* 2 **4
### What happened? 
----
### Order of operations
* '+' = Addition

* '-' = Subtraction

* '/' = Division

* '*' = Multiplication

* '**' = Exponent

* '//' = Integer division

* '%' = Modulus remainder
----
### You can also enter code one line at a time in the REPL. Here is our first program using the "print" function. 
![Hello World](https://github.com/donwatkins/PyGirls4Good/blob/master/Images/HelloWorld.png)

### Use the "print" function to enter your name in the REPL. Here is the sample code: 
* print("Your Name")
* print("I go to Olean Middle School")
* print("I like chocolate")
