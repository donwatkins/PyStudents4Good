# PyGirls4Good
### WNY Women's Foundation Grant Program at St. Bonaventure University
The girls served by the program will come from area school districts with whom St. Bonaventure University has an established rapport. This on campus enrichment activity seeks to inculcate a sense of community, healthy self esteem and a desire for higher education. Each of the participants will receive a Raspberry Pi computer. Each will learn how to assemble a Raspberry Pi computer and all its associated peripherals. Each participant will receive individual and group instruction with the Python computer language. A variety of programming examples and lessons along with opportunity for iterations of those programs will ensure that all of the students experience a high degree of success. All girls will also receive a [Circuit Playground Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/overview) which is a programmable wearable takeaway from the program that could function as a broche, necklace, earring(s), ornament, scientific instrument that will invite further exploration of  programming in the Python Environment. 

All students will receive a PDF copy of [Python for Kids](https://nostarch.com/pythonforkids) and [Teach Your Kids to Code](https://nostarch.com/teachkids). All students will have access to a Github respository which contain all learning materials, sample code and other educational materials.
