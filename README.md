# Raspberry Pi 400 and Python for Students

Originally developed for a grant with the Western New York Womens Foundation these materials were created to provide instruction for students who want to learn how to use a Raspberry Pi computer and get started with coding with Python. I have drawn on my experience working with a variety of students who have been both children and adults. Much of the code examples are taken from Dr. Bryson Payne's [Teach Your Kids to Code](http://teachyourkidstocode.com/), Jason Briggs[Python for Kids](https://nostarch.com/pythonforkids) and Al Sweigart's [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
Included in this material are a recommended reading list and introductory materials about the Raspberry Pi computer.
