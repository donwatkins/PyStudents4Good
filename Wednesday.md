### A simple poem
```
print("This program will help you write a simple three line poem")
first_line  = input("What is the first line of the poem?")
second_line = input("What is the second line of the poem?")

# New Turtle Learning

```
# A new spiral
import turtle as t
t.shape("turtle")
t.pencolor("blue")
t.pensize(4)
t.speed(5)

for x in range(4):
t.forward(100)
t.left(90)
```
1. Change the color to green. 
2. Change the color to red.
3. Change the pensize to make the line thinner.
4. Change the turtle shape.(“arrow”, “turtle”, “circle”, “square”, “triangle”, “classic”.)
